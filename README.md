# MKW Mogi Manager

## Overview

**MKW Mogi Manager** is a tool to simplify tracking scores during competitive **Mario Kart World Lounge mogis**. Instead of manually writing down results, the app captures screenshots of the scoreboard, reads the names and scores, and keeps track of everything automatically. At the end of the session, you can export results in the format needed for **Lounge Discord bots**, along with a full package of screenshots and race data for reference.

## Fixing Problems

Sometimes the app might not read everything perfectly. Here's what you can do:

* **No names detected** ‚Äì Make sure you're on the results or pause screen and try again.
* **Wrong name or score** ‚Äì Click to edit it before moving on.
* **Missing players** ‚Äì Add them in manually if needed.

## Limitations

* The app may struggle if players have **very similar in-game names**, or even **identical names in team formats**. It will do its best to match them correctly, but you may need to step in and fix these manually.
* OCR accuracy depends on **video quality**. Lower brightness or sharpness may make results harder to read.

## Tips

* Always **capture from the race results screen**, not the session rankings.
* Use the **pause menu at the start** for smoother auto-filling of names during the session.
* **Team formats** are detected automatically from the participants list.
* You don't need to upload anything online. Everything runs **locally in your browser**.
